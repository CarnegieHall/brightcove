# Brightcove javascript customizations

## About
A place to store the script and track changes. With it uploaded here we can access it through a CDN.

## Usage
Access the script using jsdelivr. For example [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CarnegieHall/brightcove/brightcove_custom_scripts.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CarnegieHall/brightcove/brightcove_custom_scripts.min.js).

## Updating
When updating the script you should make all your changes and then tag a new version using [semver](https://semver.org/). You can pass the new jsdelivr url with version to the team to make the updates in Brightcove.
It is NOT recommended to work without a version.
